Description: AStrap is an R package for identifying alternative splicing (AS) 
    events and distinguishing AS types from transcripts without a reference 
    genome in plants and mammals. It can distinguish the most prevalent AS 
    types including intron retention (IR), exon skipping (ES), alternative 
    donor sites (AltD), and alternative acceptor sites (AltA). Moreover, 
    AStrap enables users to customize the classification model by selecting 
    different classifiers for model training. Different classifiers 
    (including SVM, RF, and AdaBoost) are available in AStrap for predicting 
    AS events and optimal parameters of the corresponding classifier can be 
    automatically estimated from users¡¯ data sets.
